Project Discription
McDonald's , renowned as a global fast-food chain with a diverse menu , is currently under scrutiny by me as a data analyst. My focus lies in analyzing the nutritional content of the menu items offered at McDonald's outlets. This analytical endeavor aims to uncover valuable insights pertaining to the calorie counts and nutritional facts associated with a range of menu items.
Objectives:
1.	Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
2.	Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
3.	Create visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
4.	Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.
